## HelpMyCar App



This is the repository of the SEP / IAD student project of team Greenbox Collective.
The goal of this project is to create a roadside assistance application that uses the Caruso API to gather vehicle information, 
which is used to support both the driver and the assistance operator.

<br>
The project consists of two frontend web-apps and a backend application:
- A driver app to request help in the case of a car failure.
- A dashbord app where an assistant operator can see and respond to help requests.
- A backend application that acts as a REST-service for the frontend and sends http-requests to the Caruso-API to gather vehicle information.
